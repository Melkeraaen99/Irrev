# Irrev
Project in TKJ4200 irreversible thermodynamics

In this project, we have plotted different dimensionless transport coefficients calculated with kinetic gas theory.

We have used Revised Enskog theory and Residual Entropy Scaling.

See documentation for PyKingas and Thermopack to be able to run the code
